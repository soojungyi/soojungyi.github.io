# **Soojung Yi, Ph.D.**

I am a biophysical chemist studying how genetic information and protein–protein interactions are organized and regulated inside living bacterial cells.  
My research integrates quantitative live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis, microfluidics, bacterial physiology, and protein biochemistry.

During my Ph.D. at Seoul National University, I developed **KD-FRET**, a quantitative FRET-based method for directly measuring protein–protein interaction strengths inside living bacteria (Advanced Science, Editor’s Choice).  
I also applied long-term microfluidics imaging to investigate transcription–translation dynamics in *Vibrio natriegens*, the fastest-growing known bacterium.

I am currently continuing this research as a postdoctoral fellow at the Research Institute for Basic Sciences, Seoul National University.
